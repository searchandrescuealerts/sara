			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>SARA (Search and Rescue Alerts) harnesses the power of caring citizens to help find missing people and return them safely home.  SARA uses cell phone texts to alert the public about missing persons so they can help search as they go about their daily activities.  Text messages are sent to your phone from approved Law Enforcement agencies which may include a photo and description of the individual, information about the circumstances, and details about organized searches or places where tips can be directed.  A Missing Person Poster in the palm of your hand!</p>

			<p>People who want to receive notifications of missing persons in your area are invited to register for SARA on this website. Supported Law Enforcement agencies will send time-sensitive notifications directly to your phone or computer.</p>

			<p>First responders are approved in advance of an official search and may receive priority alerts.  If you opt in as a first responder, your information will be used for a background check.  If an official search is organized in a specific area, you will be notified of the place and time.  Then you may be pre-approved to search and can skip the lines at the search headquarters.</p>

			<h2>"I would want everyone looking for my child if something went wrong."</h2>
